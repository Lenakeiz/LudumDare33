Oh nice! Finally! Where have you been?!?... You seem changed... anyway we are already in late. Let's move on!

So we have already set the cameras around the place... In totally there are 4 different cameras, one in each room. It is up to you to find where they are so you will remember better.

Your job today is just following my tasks. Each of them consists on bringing one or more actors in front of a certain camera and in a certain state of fear.

In order to do so you can use the skills we have teached you while ago... What?! You already forgot them?! No problem... take a look down there.

You can use you CHILL (Q) power to immediately confuse the actor and stop them.

With your CLONE (W) you can scare actors in any direction you want. Remember that you can place the clone and choose the direction afterwards.

Finally with your SCREAM (E) you will make people run out from you. Beware that this cause the maximum amount of fear and actors can react very bad to it.

Each power has a timer for which it stays active as well as a cooldown before can be utilized again. So choose wisely!

Also tasks can be done in any order you want... the important is that you don't make the production run out of film!

So if there are any questions I will go behind the screens! SHOW ME THE STAR WITHIN YOU!

(Mmmmh I am still thinking something is changed...)
